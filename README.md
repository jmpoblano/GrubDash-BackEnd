# GrubDash-BackEnd
This project is focused on creating Middleware, routers, and controllers for an application. This is my first Back end design from scratch.

# Programming
To test queries and console, I created a DB on Elephant SQL, and connected with DBeaver to run checks on my queries. I used VSC to complete my qualified tests.
